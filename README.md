# Post-HTML
This is a quick JFrame GUI that allows me to quickly add to my website.

<h2>Write-Up</h2>

I made this program when making my website so that I could have a less tedious time adding information to the site. I wanted
to have a page that I could put images on, as well as a title and a description for each, but copy-pasting the information
was annoying to do, especially when having to insert links.

This program lets you input two links for images, a title, and a description, then creates the HTML text that will display the images and other information in their respective divs, so that the CSS can apply when uplaoded.
